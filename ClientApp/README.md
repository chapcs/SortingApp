## BUILD STEPS

Implement algorithm: You can create a new service in Angular to implement in typescript
Display algorithm: You can create a new component in Angular. This can call the service to run the algorithm and then display the results. Angular uses a declarative approache for updating UI, so when the data changes, Angular will automatically update the UI
Routing: 
Remember that this works with both the ASP.NET Core backend and the Angular frontend development.

Algorithms: bubblesort, heapsort, mergesort, quicksort

Process: need to run npm install before ng serve in the ClientApp folder

# SortingApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.0.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
